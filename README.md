# Venkata Anirudh Pillala's Code Review 
## By Kiran kumar Nimmakayala

Code Review:

Anirudh's code computes the Leibniz Series.

The initial code is fairly efficient; however, I made a minor optimization by calculating the formula only once in the iteration instead of calculating it twice for each iteration.

I've also changed a few variable names and a few comments to make the code more readable.
